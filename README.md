# Byte Doesn't Dance - lab 2 - variant 1

- Unrolled linked list is a variant of linked list data structure. Its
- main purpose is to reduce pointer overhead and improve cache hit rate.
- In this program, we implement a data structure based on Unrolled Linked List.
- This data structure provides common linked list operations, including adding,
- getting, setting, and removing elements, as well as other advanced operations
- such as inversion, filtering, mapping, reduction, etc. Through these operations,
- we can store and operate elements of integer type in unrolled Linked List.

## Project structure

- `list.py` -- implementation of `UnrolledNode` class and `UnrolledLinkedList` class
- with multiple functions, including adding, getting, setting, and removing elements,
- as well as other advanced operations
- `List_test.py` -- unit and PBT tests for `unrolled linked list`.

## Design notes

- Compared with traditional singly linked lists, unrolled linked lists store multiple
- elements in one node instead of one element corresponding to one node. This allows
- us to focus on storing multiple elements in a single node to reduce memory overhead
- and improve cache hits. It has advantages of efficiency. When the number of elements
- is large, unrolled linked list can improve memory utilization and access efficiency.
